 1.4.4 :
 - test/cpp/list_free_segs.C : to list free segments in a out.root file.
 - wroot/file : set_END() : update first back free segment m_first field
   when writing something. This permits to have good free segs infos in file.
 - wroot/file/make_free_seg : use free_seg/add_free() function.
 - wroot/free_seg : add_free function.

 1.4.3 :
 - histo/b3,h3d : have a print() method. (Few things in it for the moment...)
 - histo/sliced : for h3 : projection_[xy,yz,xz] methods.
 - test/cpp/histo.cpp : example of a h3d with some projections.   

 1.4.2 :
 - histo/h3::fill : bug correction : line 69 [3] -> [2].
 - test/cpp/use_cpp : g++ : have the -shadow option.
 - histo/c[1,2,3]d : set_histogram(), s_class() : methods needed when
   creating back objects when reading an AIDA xml file.
   (In fact not used today since reading files is not used in G4).
 - modifs in typedefs, cids, tos, vmanip : the same, coming from modifs
   in inlib related to the reading of files.

 1.4.1 : 21 Aug 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - wroot/file, free_seg : handle (and save) "free segments".
   It permits to open the file correctly when opening back
   from CERN-ROOT with "UPDATE" mode.

 1.4.0 : 20 Aug 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - Handle "axis title for plotting" through annotations.
   See examples/cpp/[wroot,waxml].cpp for examples.
 - Arrange so that "axis title for plotting" be saved in .root file
   so that ROOT plotting handle these titles.
 - Save annotations for the AIDA file format.
 - NOTE : it does not seem to have an HBOOK API to save
   per histogram "axis title for plotting" in a HBOOK file.

 1.3.2 : 17 Aug 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - base_histo : have annotations.

 1.3.1 : 24 Jul 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - hbook/h1,h2,p1 : have a configure() method to rebook.
 - hbook/h1,h2,p1,base_histo : have title(),reset(),all_entries()
   on base_histo.

 1.3.0 : 20 Jul 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - add file/class ntuple_booking to capture a ntuple booking parameters.
 - hbook/wntuple, waxml/ntuple, wcsv_ntuple : add a constructor receiving
   a ntuple_booking object.
 - tests/cpp/[waxml,whbook,wroot,wcsv_booking].cpp : have an example of usage
   of the creation of an ntuple by using a ntuple_booking object.

 1.2.1 : 19 Jul 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - histo/b1,b2,b3 : have public configure methods to rebook an existing
   histogram.
 - histo/b3 constructor : variable ns changed to nbins to remove a
   "-shadow pinaillage" warning.
 - change "private" to "protected" in various classes to let things
   opened via inheritance.
 - test/cpp/build : g++ : -shadow.
 - test/cpp/build : CYGWIN : changes to build also with VisualStudio 2009.

 1.2.0 : 28 May 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - waxml/ntuple : do not write the default option in the column element.
   It permits to have XML files with ntuple readable by jas3.
   The 1.4 release of ioda can also read these files.
 - sto : remove the "tellg() logic". There is a difference of comportement
   of tellg() in the g++ 4.6.x versions. We use now fail() to detect
   if a stream conversion toward numbers is ok or not.
 - tools/hbook/base_histo : have an hbook_id() method to get the... HBOOK ID!
 - tools/hbook/h1,h2,base_histo : displace scale() on base_histo.
 - tools/hbook/h1,h2,base_histo : add(),subtract(),multiply(),divide() methods.
   (To please Michel).
 - Slight corrections to remove messages from the -Wshadow "pinaillage" option.
   (Hell, if a compiler misunderstands the name of a local variable with the
   name of a method...)
 - Slight corrections to compile with clang++.
 - modify test/cpp/build to build the C++ programs from CYGWIN by using
   the Visual Studio compiler.

 1.1.0 : 8 Feb 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - split the fill_infos() function in wroot/infos.
   It was too long and induces warning with icc and g++.

 1.0.6 : 8 Feb 2012 : G.Barrand :
 - build from code of inexlib-1.3.
 - histo : some "this->" changed to "parent::".
   "this->" is needed only when invoking virtual methods.
 - have snpf to avoid too much #ifdef WIN32 for [v]snprintf.
 - have "typedef cid" in a standalone cid file.
 - remove some remaining inline keyword within class.
 - test/cpp/use_clang : to build with clang. Tested with
   clang-3.0 on MacOSX. To use clang :
     cd test/cpp
     ./build -clang
 - add this history file.
