/*! \page Examples_parallel Category "parallel"

This directory includes example applications to demonstrate the usage of
different techniques for achieving event parallelism with Geant4.

- \link ExampleParN02 ParN02 \endlink and 
  \link ExampleParN04 ParN04 \endlink are modified versions of the novice examples N02 and N04
  adapted to be run together with the TOP-C communication layer application
  on either a cluster of systems or multi-processor machines.

- \link Examples_MPI MPI \endlink is a native interface with MPI libraries. 
  The directory contains 
  a Geant4 UI library and a couple of parallelized examples.
  Using this interface, users applications can be parllelized with 
  different MPI compliant libraries, such as LAM/MPI, MPICH2, OpenMPI,
  and so on.
