<h1> Use of G3toG4 tool </h1>

This examples demonstrates the usage of the g3tog4 tool for converting 
Geant 3.21 simple geometries to Geant4 ones.

It requires Geant4 installation with G3toG4 library (
handled with GEANT4_USE_G3TOG4 option in CMake build or the G4LIB_USE_G3TOG4
environment variable in GNUmake build).

It demonstrates building a detector geometry using the call list
mechanism and also provides visualization, see the G3toG4DetectorConstruction
class. The executable is provided in clGeometry.cc.

The example uses several classes from the extended examples common repository 
(extended/common), see below their complete list. When building the example separately from Geant4 installation,
both extended/common and extended/g3tog4 directories have to be copied to a user loal build
area.

To run the application, one must provide as input argument a call list file
(few test samples are placed in ../data), generated by the rztog4 application
which can be built typing "make bin" from $G4INSTALL/source/g3tog4.

clGeometry.in is a macro to be executed either interactively or in batch.

For example:
\verbatim
> cd $G4INSTALL/examples/extended/g3tog4/clGeometry
> clGeometry ../data/testmodel.dat clGeometry.in
\endverbatim

The list of classes used from common:
- ExG4PrimaryGeneratorAction01 
- ExG4EventAction01 
- ExG4EventAction01Messenger
- ExG4RunAction01
- ExG4RunAction01Messenger
