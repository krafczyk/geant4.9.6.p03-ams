/*! \page Examples_hadronic Category "hadronic"

 Examples in this directory demonstrate specific hadronic physics simulation 
 with histogramming.

\link ExampleHadr00 Hadr00 \endlink

This example demonstrates a usage of G4PhysListFactory to build 
Physics List and G4HadronicProcessStore to access cross sections.

\link ExampleHadr01 Hadr01 \endlink

This example application is based on the application IION developed for
simulation of proton or ion beam interaction with a water target. Different 
aspects of beam target interaction are demonstrating in the example including 
longitudinal profile of energy deposition, spectra of secondary  particles,
spectra of particles leaving the target. 

\link ExampleHadr02 Hadr02 \endlink

This example application is providing simulation of ion beam interaction with different 
targets. Hadronic aspects of beam target interaction are demonstrated in the example 
including longitudinal profile of energy deposition, spectra of secondary  particles,
isotope production spectra. 

\link ExampleHadr03 Hadr03 \endlink

This example demonstrates how to compute total cross section from the direct evaluation of the 
mean free path ( see below, item Physics), how to identify nuclear reactions, how to plot 
energy spectrum of secondary particles.
